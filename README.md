Conducted unsupervised topic modeling on Reddit post titles using LDA with CountVectorizer, discovering 15 distinct themes related to Elon Musk, SpaceX, and public discourse.

Visualized topics using pyLDAvis and word clouds, highlighting key terms and their relevance across topics.

Built and analyzed egonets for influential authors (e.g., MoreMotivation) using NetworkX, identifying top connections and interaction hubs.

Applied centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness) to quantify user influence within the network.

Performed community detection using the Louvain algorithm, uncovering tightly-knit clusters and engagement patterns among Reddit users.

Constructed co-occurrence graphs and matrices to reveal keyword relationships and dominant themes in community discussions.
